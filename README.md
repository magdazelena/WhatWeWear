## engineering thesis project

### React.JS website with heavy use of WebGL

This project is public as a showcase of possibilities of webGL and Three.js use for information presentation. 
It is **not ready** for publication due to performance issues.
It's a *work in progess*.

Preview can be seen [here](http://magdazelezik.com/projekty/inz/) (if your machine can handle it ;)
